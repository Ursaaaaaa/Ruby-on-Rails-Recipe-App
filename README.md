# Recipe App

The Recipe app keeps track of all the users' recipes and ingredients. It will allow the user to save ingredients, keep track of what they have, create recipes, and generate a shopping list based on what they have and what they are missing from a recipe. Also, since sharing recipes is an important part of cooking, the app should allow the user to make them public so anyone can access them.
